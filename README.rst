============================
Reveal Videos
============================

It is a very simple chrome extension that I uses to show "hidden" .mp4 links
contained in the currently active tab.
Simply open the tab clicking on the icon and click "Find 'em!". Hopefully will
appear some video from the links contained in the page.

WHY?
====

 - To learn javascript
 - To learn how to do a simple chrome extension
 - Because some website is broken
